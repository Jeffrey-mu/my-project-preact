    "content": "<p><b>A deeper\nunderstanding of corporate financing issues from lowering the upper limit of\nprotection of private lending interest rates</b></p><p><br/></p><p>The starting point for\nlowering the upper limit of the protection of private lending interest rates is\ngood and has positive significance judicially. However, corporate financing is\nmore dictated by economic laws, and expanding the availability of corporate\nfinancing through judicial improvements is a profound topic. Lowering the upper\nlimit of private lending interest rate protection is a good exploration but\nimproving the quality of corporate financing services may require more effort.</p><p><br/></p><p>For another example,\n“Regulation of the Financial Market Investment and Financing Order” mentions\nthat “in accordance with the requirements of functional supervision, to conceal\nfinancial risks, circumvent financial supervision, and conduct institutional\narbitrage violations in the name of financial innovation, determine contract\nvalidity and rights and obligations based on their actual legal relationship”,\nand “in time study and formulate judicial response measures against financial\nphenomena such as online lending, asset management plans, over-the-counter\nfunding, asset securitization, equity crowdfunding, etc., and improve the\ninitiative and predictability of preventing and resolving major financial risks.”\nThis is the response to various so-called “regulatory arbitrage” in the name of\n“financial innovation” in recent years, and it is also in line with the general\ntrend of financial supervision and prevention of financial risks.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>As mentioned above,\nalleviating difficulties and huge costs of corporate financing is a systematic\nproject. Lowering the upper limit of judicial protection of private lending\ninterest rates is a positive measure, but it should not be imposed\nunrealistically higher expectations. There is still more work to be done to\nimprove corporate credit access and improve the quality of financial services.</p>",

If the scale\nof U.S. dollar debt is too great, there is a risk of default. As discussed in\nthe periodic fluctuations of the USD exchange rate above, when the U.S. dollar\ndebt is large-scale and the USD appreciates, the local currency value of the U.S.\ndollar debt will rise sharply, resulting in repayment difficulty. It is\nparticularly important for companies in emerging market countries, because many\ncompanies have borrowed a large amount of foreign debt in USD in the\ninternational market.

Periodic\nfluctuation of the USD exchange rate</b></p><p><br/></p><p>Some studies have shown\nthat the periodic fluctuations of the USD exchange rate have had a serious\nimpact on other countries. No matter whether the USD appreciates or\ndepreciates, the negative influence cannot be avoided. The path of the impact\nis the tidal movement of USD liquidity that accompanies the fluctuation of the\nexchange rate.</p><p><br/></p><p>When the U.S. dollar\ncontinues to appreciate, funds tend to flow to the United States, and some\ncountries are faced with a large-scale outflow of funds, which may lead to currency\ncrises in these countries, substantial currency depreciation. One of the direct\nconsequences is that the currency mismatch becomes more serious. The scale of\nforeign debt denominated in USD rises sharply after being converted into\ncurrency, which in turn will lead to debt crises.</p><p><br/></p><p>When the U.S. dollar\ncontinues to depreciate, funds will flock to other countries, especially\nemerging market economies, for the sake of high returns. On the one hand,\nlarge-scale capital inflows will promote the appreciation of the currency; on\nthe other hand, it may cause major fluctuations in the country’s financial\nmarkets and even asset bubbles. What’s more serious is that these inflows may\nbe short-term, just to obtain high returns. When the situation changes, it is\nextremely possible to escape from emerging market countries, leading to the\nbursting of asset bubbles and financial crises in these countries.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>After the 2008 global\nfinancial crisis, in view of the impact of abnormal capital liquidity on some\ncountries, the IMF has changed its previous attitude towards capital flow liberalization\nand has also advocated that appropriate tools be adopted to control\ncross-border capital flows in extraordinary periods to avoid economic and\nfinancial crisis.</p>",

But for many countries and regions, it is not easy to obtain U.S.\ndollar liquidity. For example, export products are not competitive, which means\nthat the engine of accumulating dollars is misfired, many countries only have a\nfew dollar reserves. Many import products, especially bulk commodities, need to\nbe priced in USD, creating a contradiction between insufficient USD reserves\nand unsatisfactory import demand, and this contradiction becomes more prominent\nwhen the world financial market is turbulent and capital flows out of some\ncountries. The problem has also prompted many countries to wish to start over\nand settle trade in bilateral domestic currencies, thereby avoiding the U.S.\ndollar’s imprisonment of transaction.</p><p><br/></p><p>In addition, some countries\nhave borrowed a large amount of foreign debt in USD in the international\nmarket, and the insufficient USD reserve also causes these countries to default\non foreign debts, especially when the foreign debt maturity structure is unreasonable.\nAt the beginning of this year when the pandemic spread across the world, market\nsentiment suddenly changed, USD liquidity was extremely short, and USD interest\nrates soared. Many countries faced substantial capital outflows, while foreign\ndebts were due. Lebanon and Argentina had defaulted on foreign debts and the\nsituation of other countries was also precarious. The G20 urgently introduced\nthe Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), and the IMF also provided\nlarge-scale loans, which gradually eased the circumstances.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>It is also worth noting\nthat if the United States believes that its interests are harmed, it will\nimpose sanctions on market entities and countries that use USD, which will also\naffect some countries and market entities. Significant influence.</p>",
